#Low Profile Thumb Prosthesis

![Photo of assembled prosthesis](docs/images/complete_prosthesis.jpg)

This prosthesis is designed to provide a static thumb post for patients who have one or more fingers with a good range of motion, but no thumb to oppose against. The prosthesis consists of a silicone sleeve that goes around the patient's palm, tightened by a velcro strap. A mounting point for a static thumb post (optionally with a grippy silicone cover) is molded into the sleeve.

See the [assembly documentation](http://daprice.github.io/Shriner-Hands/docs/documentation.html) for more information and instructions for configuring and assembling one.
